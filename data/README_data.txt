Here are a few samples from the candidates that I have collected. Each candidate has his or her own directory. This includes a variety of sources: press releases, debates, speeches, interviews, etc. The title of the files should be indicative. The debates directory is the full transcripts, from which each candidates statements are copied into their own directory.

All non-text or verbal comments have been removed (i.e. markers for applause in the debate transcripts). Furthermore, during debates I have concatenated trailing ... and preceding ... into one sentence if they occur (i.e. pause for laughter is marked that way).

In some of the candidates directories, there are some .raw files. These are unprocessed, annotated files that are processed *manually* before any scripts are run.
