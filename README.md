This is some basic code for analyzing the 2016 Presidential candidates using Natural Language Processing/Computational Linguistics. It is inspired by a viral video analyzing Donald Trump's use of Langauge. You can see how the code is used here: http://kentonmurray.com/blogs/comp_linguistic_2016.html

This makes heavy use of NLTK. I also use pattern.en and the Berkeley Parser. All of these need to be downloaded separately.

See README_data.txt for info on the data sets
